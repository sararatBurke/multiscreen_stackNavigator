# multiscreen_stackNavigator

Repository containing useful code: https://github.com/mattkrebs2000/RNStackNavigator

The challenge is to recreate the webpage (whose image is below in the provided link) on React Native and add in a Stack Navigator. In total your App should have 5 screens. The 1st screen will be the recreation of the webpage provided. A second screen should feature a description of what all of the pages are. The 3 remaining pages should have ImageBackgrounds using the images provided in the webpage. Make it so that you can navigate from every page in the App to every other page in the App. On one of the pages you should have a "more" dropdown button that allows you to choose which screen you would like to go to.

The actual webpage which is to be reproduced as part of this challenge can be found here:
